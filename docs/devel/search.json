    "text": "Cancer data science is a vast field with considerable history and impact. Materials assembled in this book aim to give a flavor of the questions entertained and of the methods employed by researchers in cancer epidemiology, biology, and treatment.\nFundamental questions arise whenever we contemplate sources of cancer risk and public health responses to cancer.\n\nHow should we count cancers and communicate this information to the public and to decisionmakers?\nWhat features of environment and lifestyle affect cancer risk? Are variations in geographic distribution of cancer types related to pollution or regionally variable lifestyle patterns?\nHow does progress in methods of cell biology help us to pinpoint molecular processes underlying cancer and its spread?\nWhat kinds of experiments are needed to create and improve effective treatments for cancer?\n\nIn this book we take advantage of the R language, the CRAN repository of R packages for general data science, and the Bioconductor project that provides many R packages and data resources for genomic data science. Relevant texts are:\n\nPeter Dalgaard, Introductory Statistics with R\nGareth James, Daniela Witten et al., An Introduction to Statistical Learning\n\nThe Bioconductor website and support site are also potentially helpful.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

It is a program developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI). Data are collected at 17 regional centers.\nThe SEER web site, offers various facets of cancer data to investigate.\n\n\nSEERlist\n\n\n1.2.2 Body sites with relatively high cancer incidence\n\n\nSEER 2021 pie charts\n\n\n1.2.3 New diagnoses, and deaths, over time\nA very broad overview of cancer‚Äôs impact on Americans over the past 20 years:\n\n\nSEER overview, 2021\n\n\n1.2.4 Exercises\nA.2.1 The display just above asserts that over 1.8 million Americans will present with a new cancer diagnosis in 2021.

A review of cancer cluster investigations was published in 2012. Results:\n\nWe reviewed 428 investigations evaluating 567 cancers of concern. An increase in incidence was confirmed for 72 (13%) cancer categories (including the category ‚Äúall sites‚Äù). Three of those were linked (with variable degree of certainty) to hypothesized exposures, but only one investigation revealed a clear cause.\n\nThe conclusion of this report:\n\nThere are fundamental shortcomings to our current methods of investigating community cancer clusters. We recommend a multidisciplinary national dialogue on creative, innovative approaches to understanding when and why cancer and other chronic diseases cluster in space and time.\n\nThis motivates us to learn about map production and rate estimation in YES for CURE.\n\n2.1.2 Exercises\nUse the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) map tool to survey mortality from cancer in 2020 for individuals aged 10-24. You should see something like the display below.\n\n\nIARC map\n\nB.1.1 True or False: Age standardized mortality from cancer in 2020 for persons aged 10-24 is greater in Vietnam than in neighboring countries.\nUse the IARC map tool to produce a worldwide map of breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79.\nB.1.2 What is the Scandinavian country with largest estimate of age-standardized breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79?"

    "text": "4.6 Blinding and randomization to reduce bias\nThe concept of the double-blind clinical experiment is well-established\n\nThe investigator does not know what treatment has been given to the patient\nThe patient does not know what drug they have received\n\nThis is accomplished by providing treatments that are identical in appearance, taste, etc., but differ in their chemical composition and hypothesized effects. An independent party has knowledge of the treatment that has been administered, and can decode the treatment assignments as needed.\nThe role of blinding in experimentation is reviewed in a Nature commentary, and the Wikipedia article has many useful references.\n\n4.6.1 Randomization to reduce bias\nOnce blinding has been accomplished it may seem unnecessary to take further steps to eliminate bias in the evaluation of an experimental comparison.\nBlinding helps to eliminate specific forms of bias rooted in (possibly un- or sub-conscious) investigator or participant actions that may affect experimental outcomes or interpretation.\nOther forms of bias can be mitigated using random allocation of treatments to participants. As an illustration suppose an investigator decides to use ‚Äúalternating assignments‚Äù, and typically sees two eligible patients a day. We could then have\n                Day 1    Day 2   Day 3 ....\nTreatment      A    B    A   B   A   B\nTime of day    AM   PM   AM  PM  AM  PM\nA problem would arise if the characteristics of patients coming in the morning were different from those coming in the afternoon. For example, the patients arriving in the AM slot could tend to be older. The comparison between treatments A and B would then be confounded with a difference in average ages of patients in the experiment.\nIf, instead of alternation, the treatment assignment were randomized, the patients receiving treatment A would have characteristics that are on average indistinguishable from those receiving treatment B.\nDetails of the approach to randomization will have an impact on its effectivness. Challenges can arise in multicenter studies with many centers. The following display plots the excess numbers of patients assigned to one arm in a trial, against the total number enrolled.\n\n\nExcursions 1\n\nThere are long stretches of time during which more patients in the study are receiving one of the treatments than the other.\nThe use of a different approach to randomization, in which small blocks of allocations are randomized independently, can reduce the size and duration of periods of imbalance over time.\n\n\nExcursions 2\n\nRandomization is a well-accepted tool in experimental design, but must be conducted with care. The wikipedia article has some interesting references on assessment of the overall effect of use of randomization in health research."
