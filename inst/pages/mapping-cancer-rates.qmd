# Mapping cancer rates


## Cancer across the globe

### Interactive cancer maps

* Twenty years ago the most common Geographic Information System was the paper map or road atlas
* Now our cell-phones can ask the internet how to get to where we want to go, efficiently
* Understanding how cancer events unfold in different geographic regions is important for public health
	* Are there important environmental hazards at specific locations?
	* Are there clues to genetic origins of particular cancers?
	* Are culturally shared behaviors leading to increased risk?
* Even though we are comfortable with annotated maps, creating and using "cancer maps" to reason about cancer risk requires some training
* In this notebook we will work with some interactive maps on the web, and we will produce some maps using R programming

A basic concern in mapping cancer rates is discovery of "clusters".  A review of cancer cluster investigations
was [published in 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22519802/).  Results:

> We reviewed 428 investigations evaluating 567 cancers of concern. An increase in incidence was confirmed for 72 (13%) cancer categories (including the category "all sites"). Three of those were linked (with variable degree of certainty) to hypothesized exposures, but only one investigation revealed a clear cause.

The conclusion of this report:

> There are fundamental shortcomings to our current methods of investigating community cancer clusters. We recommend a multidisciplinary national dialogue on creative, innovative approaches to understanding when and why cancer and other chronic diseases cluster in space and time.

This motivates us to learn about map production and rate estimation in YES for CURE.

### Exercises

Use the [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) map tool](https://gco.iarc.fr/today/online-analysis-map?v=2020&mode=population&mode_population=continents&population=900&populations=900&key=asr&sex=0&cancer=39&type=0&statistic=5&prevalence=0&population_group=0&ages_group%5B%5D=0&ages_group%5B%5D=17&nb_items=10&group_cancer=1&include_nmsc=0&include_nmsc_other=0&projection=natural-earth&color_palette=default&map_scale=quantile&map_nb_colors=5&continent=0&show_ranking=0&rotate=%255B10%252C0%255D) to survey mortality from cancer in 2020 for individuals aged 10-24. You should see something like the display below.

![IARC map](https://github.com/vjcitn/YESCDS/blob/main/man/figures/IARCoverall.jpg?raw=true)

B.1.1 True or False: Age standardized mortality from cancer in 2020 for persons aged 10-24 is greater in Vietnam than in neighboring countries.

Use the IARC map tool to produce a worldwide map of breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79.

B.1.2 What is the Scandinavian country with largest estimate of age-standardized breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79?




# Enhancing tables with geography

## Basic geographic data about US counties

The coordinates of central locations in US counties
are provided in `us_county_geo`.

```{r lkd3a}
data(us_county_geo)
us_county_geo |> select(state, county, geometry) |> head()
```

Coordinates for metropolitan statistical areas are provided by
"statcrunch":
```{r kd4}
data(statcrunch_msa)
head(statcrunch_msa)
```

This geographic data has already been used to enhance the CDC incidence data
in `woncan`:
```{r lk5}
data(woncan)
woncan |> group_by(MSA) |> 
    summarize(lat=head(lat)[1], lng=head(lng)[1]) |> head()
```

### Exercise

B.2.1 Create a new notebook cell and run `YESCDS::table_woncan("Prostate")`

B.2.2 Use this table to find the latitude and longitude of Boston.

## An interactive map of the US with cancer rates

After combining cancer rate data for a collection
of cancer types and metropolitan statistical areas,
we can produce a map showing variation in
cancer incidence over the United States.
Here is the example for stomach cancer:

```{r domaca}
cancer_map_usa(site="Stomach")

```

### Exercise

B.2.3 Create a new notebook cell and run `cancer_map_usa(site="Prostate", scaling=0.05)`

B.2.4 Can you identify the area with the highest incidence of prostate cancer?


## A data graphic

Finally, to get a different view of variation in cancer rates across the United States,
run a cell with the following command.  Geographic location is lost, but the range of variation, and
details of variation can be seen very clearly in these displays.

```
browseURL("https://vjcitn.shinyapps.io/ratevariation")
```

### Exercise

B.2.5 Change the body site to "Pancreas" (remove "Brain") and find, using the histogram tab,
the areas with highest and lowest age-adjusted rates of pancreatic cancer.


# Cancer in our counties"

```{r setup6,echo=FALSE,results="hide"}
suppressMessages({
 suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(YESCDS)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(DT)
data(woncan_meta)
data(woncan)
library(sf)
littab = woncan |> select(MSA, `Cancer Sites`, Age.Adjusted.Rate) |> as.data.frame()
  })
 })
```

## Cancer rates in Massachusetts counties, tabulated


```{r lkd3ab}
datatable(MA_cancer_rate_table())
```

## Mapping the rates

```{r lkd4ab}
mass_cancer_map()
```

## Addressing uncertainty in the rates

The reported rates are statistics collected
over time and are adjusted using a model for
age distribution in the US.  The counts on which
the reported rates are imprecise.  Therefore
"confidence limits" are produced with the rate estimates.

Here are the prostate cancer rates in Massachusetts counties,
plotted with confidence limits.

```{r lkd5ab}
plotwci(MA_cancer_rate_table("prostate"), ylim=c(90,270))
```

One message from this display is that prostate
cancer in Nantucket county has an estimated age-adjusted incidence in
2014-2018 of about 200 cases per 100000 men,
but the actual rate may be lower or higher.
The uncertainty of the estimate arises from the
relatively small population of Nantucket county.

## Exercises

B.3.1 What are the reported population sizes for Middlesex
and Nantucket counties?

B.3.2 Run the following chunk to produce a different
representation of incidence rates for cancers
of lung and bronchus in California counties:

```
ordered_seg_cal()
```

Two statistics are presented for the 
US as a whole and for the entire state of California.

B.3.3 True or False: We are fairly confident that the incidence
of cancers of lung and bronchus in San Joaquin county is
lower than that of the US as a whole.

The midpoint of the plotted interval is the estimated
incidence rate.

B.3.4 Which California counties have incidence rates that
are around half that of the US as a whole?
