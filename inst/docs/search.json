    "text": "3.1 Cancer across the globe”\n\n3.1.1 Interactive cancer maps\n\nTwenty years ago the most common Geographic Information System was the paper map or road atlas\nNow our cell-phones can ask the internet how to get to where we want to go, efficiently\nUnderstanding how cancer events unfold in different geographic regions is important for public health\n\nAre there important environmental hazards at specific locations?\nAre there clues to genetic origins of particular cancers?\nAre culturally shared behaviors leading to increased risk?\n\n\nEven though we are comfortable with annotated maps, creating and using “cancer maps” to reason about cancer risk requires some training\nIn this notebook we will work with some interactive maps on the web, and we will produce some maps using R programming\n\nA basic concern in mapping cancer rates is discovery of “clusters”. A review of cancer cluster investigations was published in 2012. Results:\n\nWe reviewed 428 investigations evaluating 567 cancers of concern. An increase in incidence was confirmed for 72 (13%) cancer categories (including the category “all sites”). Three of those were linked (with variable degree of certainty) to hypothesized exposures, but only one investigation revealed a clear cause.\n\nThe conclusion of this report:\n\nThere are fundamental shortcomings to our current methods of investigating community cancer clusters. We recommend a multidisciplinary national dialogue on creative, innovative approaches to understanding when and why cancer and other chronic diseases cluster in space and time.\n\nThis motivates us to learn about map production and rate estimation in YES for CURE.\n\n3.1.2 Exercises\nUse the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) map tool to survey mortality from cancer in 2020 for individuals aged 10-24. You should see something like the display below.\n\n\nIARC map\n\nB.1.1 True or False: Age standardized mortality from cancer in 2020 for persons aged 10-24 is greater in Vietnam than in neighboring countries.\nUse the IARC map tool to produce a worldwide map of breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79.\nB.1.2 What is the Scandinavian country with largest estimate of age-standardized breast cancer incidence for women aged 60-79?"

    "text": "7.1 Randomization to reduce bias\nOnce blinding has been accomplished it may seem unnecessary to take further steps to eliminate bias in the evaluation of an experimental comparison.\nBlinding helps to eliminate specific forms of bias rooted in (possibly un- or sub-conscious) investigator or participant actions that may affect experimental outcomes or interpretation.\nOther forms of bias can be mitigated using random allocation of treatments to participants. As an illustration suppose an investigator decides to use “alternating assignments”, and typically sees two eligible patients a day. We could then have\n                Day 1    Day 2   Day 3 ....\nTreatment      A    B    A   B   A   B\nTime of day    AM   PM   AM  PM  AM  PM\nA problem would arise if the characteristics of patients coming in the morning were different from those coming in the afternoon. For example, the patients arriving in the AM slot could tend to be older. The comparison between treatments A and B would then be confounded with a difference in average ages of patients in the experiment.\nIf, instead of alternation, the treatment assignment were randomized, the patients receiving treatment A would have characteristics that are on average indistinguishable from those receiving treatment B.\nDetails of the approach to randomization will have an impact on its effectivness. Challenges can arise in multicenter studies with many centers. The following display plots the excess numbers of patients assigned to one arm in a trial, against the total number enrolled.\n\n\nExcursions 1\n\nThere are long stretches of time during which more patients in the study are receiving one of the treatments than the other.\nThe use of a different approach to randomization, in which small blocks of allocations are randomized independently, can reduce the size and duration of periods of imbalance over time.\n\n\nExcursions 2\n\nRandomization is a well-accepted tool in experimental design, but must be conducted with care. The wikipedia article has some interesting references on assessment of the overall effect of use of randomization in health research."

    "text": "2.2 Cancer rates and public health\nMotivations for studying cancer at the population level are detailed on a National Cancer Institute web page.\nBriefly, cancers contribute to\n\nyears of life lost\nloss of quality of life for patients and families\nlost productivity\n\nFurthermore, as the population ages, the effects of cancer will be more pronounced as time goes on.\nAlthough cancer affects individual patients and their families in different ways, studying its impact on large populations can provide important information that influences practices, policies, and programs that directly affect the health of millions of people in the United States each year. – from the NCI web page\nThis idea of “studying [cancer’s] impact on large populations” brings us immediately to data science and statistics.\nTwo terms of epidemiology will be of use to us\n\n\nprevalence: the proportion of the population currently affected by a disease\n\nincidence: the proportion of the population, in a given time interval, that was disease-free prior to the interval but developed the disease within the interval\n\nPrevalence expresses the current burden of disease within a population.\nIncidence expresses the rapidity with which a disease grows in a population.\nFor a more detailed discussion of these terms, check this CDC site.\nAn excellent resource on rate estimation and interpretation is the online book on cancer screening by Pamela Marcus, hosted at NCI.\n\n2.2.1 Collecting cancer data\nThe role of statistics in our lives has intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPolicymakers have proposed that personal protective behaviors and legal obligations to mask or avoid traveling can change depending on the “infection rates” in localities.\nCancer Registries are systems managed at the state level that collect information on cancers as they are identified by health care providers.\n“SEER” stands for Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results. It is a program developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI). Data are collected at 17 regional centers.\nThe SEER web site, offers various facets of cancer data to investigate.\n\n\nSEERlist\n\n\n2.2.2 Body sites with relatively high cancer incidence\n\n\nSEER 2021 pie charts\n\n\n2.2.3 New diagnoses, and deaths, over time\nA very broad overview of cancer’s impact on Americans over the past 20 years:\n\n\nSEER overview, 2021\n\n\n2.2.4 Exercises\nA.2.1 The display just above asserts that over 1.8 million Americans will present with a new cancer diagnosis in 2021. Re-express this prediction as a “rate per 100,000 persons”.\nA.2.2 True or False: Of cancers newly identified in US citizens in 2021, more than 8% arise in the pancreas."

You will have to make selections in the web interface. Choose the Quantiles interval type with 8 intervals. Obtain the map for both sexes, all ages. What is the county with lowest incidence of colorectal cancer?\nA.3.2 True or false: In Massachusetts, the age-adjusted incidence of colorectal cancer for individuals greater than 65 years of age is approximately ten times that of individuals less than 50 years of age.\nA.3.3 Return to cancers of colon and rectum. Form a map for Area “United States”, Area Type “By State”. Limit to age less than 50. Which state has the highest incidence of colorectal cancer in this age group?\nA.3.4 Data presented by the Environmental Protection Agency can be seen at Exhibit 5 of the current Report on the Environment. What is the estimated incidence rate for colorectal cancer for females in 2017 (end of the curve)? How does this compare to the “State Cancer Profile” statistic for females of all ages?\nA.3.5 Using the EPA chart in Exhibit 5, which type of cancer in females shows a steady decrease in incidence from 2000 to 2017?"
